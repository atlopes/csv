## Methods

External:

### `Import (Filename[, CursorName[, Database]]) AS Integer`
Imports a CSV file into a cursor (name comes from `m.Filename` if `m.CursorName` is not given), or into a new table of a `m.Database`. If no `m.CursorName`is given and `WorkArea` is not empty, the data is appended to the cursor referenced by `WorkArea` (that is, set `WorkArea` to enter append mode).
Returns 0 if successful, -1 if the file could not be located, or > 0 for a VFP error number.

### `ImportString (Source[, CursorName[, Database]]) AS Integer`
Imports a CSV formatted memory string into a cursor. Wraps a call to `Import()` by creating a temporary file that holds the string contents.

### `Export (Filename[, AllRecords[, Append]]) AS Integer`
Exports a cursor to a CSV file. If `This.WorkArea` is empty, the data is exported from the current work area. If `m.AllRecords` is .T., all records from the cursor are exported, otherwise export starts at the current record position. If `m.Append` is .T., exported data is appended to the CSV file (otherwise, the file is overwritten).
Returns 0 if successful, -1 if the file could not be opened for writing, or > 0 for a VFP error number.

### `PreEncodeBinaryValue (Unencoded) AS String`
Prepares binary data for output, according to `BinaryEncoding`.

### `ProcessStep (Phase, Done, ToDo)`
Event issued when the importer goes to another step (`m.Phase` can be 0 for CSV file reading, 1 for data type checking, and 2 for cursor filling).

### `RestoreDefaultProperties ()`
Reset the properties to their default values.

### `ScanBinary (Source) AS Blob`
Scans an encoded `m.Source`. Returns .NULL. if `m.Source` does not encodes binary data according to `BinaryEncoding`.

### `ScanDate (Source[, IsTime]) AS DateOrDatetime`
Scans a formatted date (or datetime) `m.Source`. Returns .NULL. if `m.Source` does not match the date patterns.

### `ScanLogical (Source) AS Boolean`
Scans a formatted logical `m.Source`. Returns .NULL. if `m.Source` does not match the representation of the logical values.

### `ScanNumber (Source) AS Number`
Scans a formatted numeric `m.Source`. Returns .NULL. if `m.Source` does not represent a numeric value.

### `EncodeValue (Unencoded) AS String`
Encodes a value, while verifying it does not conflict with delimiters and separators. 

### `OutputDate (Source) AS String`
Outputs a date according to the format defined by `DatePattern` or `DatetimePattern`.

### `OutputLogical (Source) AS String`
Outputs a logical according to the format defined by `LogicalFalse` and `LogicalTrue` properties.

### `OutputNumber (Source) AS String`
Outputs a number.

Internal:

### `CloseFile ()`
Closes the CSV file.

### `ColumnType (CursorName, ColumnName) AS String`
Returns the type of the column (M, V*nn*, I, B, L, D, or T).

### `GetLine () AS String`
Reads a line from the CSV file (returns .NULL. on EOF).

### `GetLineContents () AS Collection`
Reads a line from the CSV file logical CSV line (which may spread for several actual lines). `.Count = 0` when  there is no more lines to read.

### `OpenFile (Filename) AS Boolean`
Opens a CSV file (.T., on success).

### `CreateFile (Filename) AS Boolean`
Creates a CSV file (.T. on success)

### `AppendToFile (Filename) AS Boolean`
Opens a CSV file for appending (.T., on success).

### `PutLine (Contents) AS Boolean`
Writes a line into the CSV file.
